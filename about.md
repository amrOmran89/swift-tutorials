Hi, I'm Amr Omran.

I'm an iOS engineer who loves building clean, pragmatic apps with Swift and SwiftUI. I write about real‑world patterns, concurrency, testing, and architecture — with clear, copy‑paste‑ready examples.

You'll find tutorials and notes here on:

- SwiftUI fundamentals, layout, and modifiers
- Concurrency (async/await, Task, MainActor)
- App architecture and best practices
- Localization and building for both English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL)

I publish in English and Arabic when it helps more people. If a post sparks an idea or you spot something to improve, I'd love to hear your feedback.
