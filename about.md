Hi, I’m Amr Omran.

I’ve been building iOS apps professionally since 2014, and over the years I’ve worked across the full Apple stack from **UIKit** projects to modern **SwiftUI** apps. My day-to-day toolkit includes **Swift**, **Combine**, and the latest **Swift concurrency** features.

What excites me most is **reactive programming** and **software architecture**: finding simple, scalable solutions to complex problems and writing code that stays clean and maintainable as products grow.

Although iOS is my main playground, I’m also curious about how other ecosystems tackle similar challenges. I regularly explore **Kotlin** and **Go**, drawing inspiration from their concurrency models and design philosophies. That cross-pollination keeps my perspective fresh and sharpens the way I build apps on every platform.

Outside of code, I’m driven by a love of continuous learning and by sharing ideas with the developer community. I write and speak in both English and Arabic, aiming to make advanced concepts approachable to more people.

If you have feedback, questions, or just want to exchange thoughts about building better software, I’d love to connect.
